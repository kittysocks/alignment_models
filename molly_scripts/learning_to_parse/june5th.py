#example: 


#aln1.fasta = infile
#aln1_models = outfile  

# infile.split(".", [0]) = outfile 


#outfile = infile.replace (".fasta")s


#list of aln files:
#for file in alnfiles:
	#run it through iqtree
	#parse to make it a csv
	
	
	
	
	#iqtree -s
	
	#.log file is what you want to parse
	#the .iqtree is already sorted
	
	
	
#library in python called OS (operating system) - set of commands 
# os.system() - put in terminal commands that will call the system through

#os.listdir() - lists all files in directory 

#list comprehension - fancy way to delete things in a list
