Hello, welcome to my R markdown file, this is example text.


```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Analysis of Data
Below, I have my csv file, called "one_csv" read by R, and imported into the markdown. I will be using the file to create plots!

```{r, include = FALSE}
one_csv <- read_csv(file="one_csv.csv")
```

```{r}
one_csv
```
I will be running one_csv through the function, ggplot, to create plots, from the tidyverse package.

Disclaimer: In my data, there is missing data, as there were errors creating trees.

#Plot One!
```{r}
one_csv %>%
  ggplot(aes(x =mean_seq_length, y = number_models)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = data_type)) +
  scale_color_manual(labels=c("aa","nt"),values=c('red','blue')) +
  theme(legend.key=element_rect(color="pink"),legend.title=element_text("Data Type"))
  
```
